# Hybrid-Semantic-Segmentation-Model-for-Emergency-Landing-of-an-Aircraft-
In emergency situations where aircraft cannot use regular runways, finding safe off-road landing areas is very important. This work uses deep learning and satellite images to identify suitable emergency landing zones. Two segmentation models, U-Net and DeepLabV3+, are combined using an optimized ensemble approach to accurately detect road networks. The proposed method improves segmentation performance and achieves high accuracy, making it useful for aviation safety and emergency landing support systems.
